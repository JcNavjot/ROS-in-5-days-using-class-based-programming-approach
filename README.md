# ROS-in-5-days-using-class-based-programming-approach
This repository contains the basic codes for ROS in 5 days course(robotignite academy) but using class programming approach instead of procedural one.

Here, I have tried to solve all the exercises myself except Robot_control class which was provided by the construct but I decided to encapsulate all the code inside the classes because the code becomes more organized using this approach. Moreover, it becomes easier to debug the code in the class approach. In some cases, I have provided both procedural and class approach side by side. 

I tested all the codes and they were working for me and should work for you as well. For any issues please send me email at navjotsinghsodhi52@gmail.com. You are free to download the code and modify it for your own case. Hope it will be helpful. I have tried to keep the code as easy as possible.
